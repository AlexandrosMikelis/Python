# Python
### User System with OOP
    What it needs: 
      -Hide characters when the user type the password
      -Hash the passwords 
      -Strong Password System
      -More details in UserDB
      -GUI ---> django or simple tkinter
      -Super users permission --- for now the only difference between a premium and simple user is a printable ticket of their type name.
